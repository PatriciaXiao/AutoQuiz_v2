		predicting the outcome of a piece of code (2017 Spring, Quest, Question 8,9,10)
	</description>
	<question>
		<p>
			<line>There are some helper blocks for control and sensing of a robot, starting in the bottom center of the grid, facing up.</line>
			<line>When calling _CODES_move forward (INPUT)_CODEE_, the robote moves _EMPHS_INPUT_EMPHE_ squares forward in the direction it is facing.</line>
			<line>When calling _CODES_rotate left_CODEE_, the robote turns 90 degrees counterclockwise, in-place.</line>
			<line>_CODES_can move {left, forward}_CODEE_ would check if there is a free square to the robot's {left, forward} to move onto, if yes, report _EMPHS_true_EMPHE_, otherwise report _EMPHS_false_EMPHE_.</line>

		<option id="c1">
			<p>
				<line>
					The robot continues moving; and it could move into a black (non-free) square if it runs for a long time.
				</line>
			</p>
		</option>
		<option id="c2">
			<p>
				<line>
					The robot continues moving; but it would never move into a black (non-free) square.
				</line>
			</p>
		</option>
		<option id="c3">
			<p>
				<line>
					The robot stays in place; and it has moved into a black (non-free) square during the iterations it went through.
				</line>
			</p>
		</option>
		<option id="c4" correct="true">
			<p>
				<line>
					The robot stays in place; it didn't, and would never move into a black (non-free) square.
