		use higher order functions to design program (2016 Fall, Quest, Question 12)
	</description>
	<question>
		<p>
			<line>For each of the following questions, indicate which of _BOLDS_map, keep,_BOLDE_ and _BOLDS_combine_BOLDE_ would be used to solve it most efficiently, and if more than one are used, in what order they are evaluated. (The computer runs inner procedures first.)</line>
			<line>For example, if you had to process a list by keeping only the numbers that are greater than 3 and then adding 10 to each, you could use:</line>

		<p>
			<line>The higher-order functions are _BOLDS_keep_BOLDE_ and then _BOLDS_map_BOLDE_, evaluated in that order, because you first _EMPHS_filter_EMPHE_ for the items greater than 3 and then add 10 to _EMPHS_every element_EMPHE_ that abbreviated list.</line>
			<line>Given a list of words and a function that reports the earlier of two values (words or numbers, etc.), return the word from a list that'd be first when listed in alphabetical order.</line>

	<hint>think about what keep (list to sublist), map (list to another list) and combine (list to a variable) does.</hint>
