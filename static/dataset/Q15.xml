	<question>
		<p>
			<line>You decide to write _CODES_love( )_CODEE_, a reporter to chart how affectionate you are (i.e., what you do) with your sweetie over the course of a given day (day 1 is your first day together, day 2 is your second, etc.). It returns a (possibly long) word whose letters are only: hugs (o), kisses (x), and just hanging out (-). The reporter _CODES_reverse_CODEE_ is provided, it'll reverse the input syting as its output.</line>

	<hint>(1) The ends of a love sequence for day larger than or equal to 3 are x and o respectively. So the middle "-" will always be buffeted by an x or o and at most three "-" in a row; (2) right to letters of love output is always "xo" after 5 days, so after 7 days, reverse( love (day - 2)) will be called and "ox" will appear; (3) "o"s only appear on the right, and next to a reversed recursive call, next to the o are always "x" / "-", so no way to get "oo".</hint>
