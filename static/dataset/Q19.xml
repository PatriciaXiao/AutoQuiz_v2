		a math trick (2017 Spring, Midterm 2, Question 3)
	</description>
	<question>
		<p>
			<line>Assume that we have two blocks: _CODES_reverse_CODEE_, which reverses the numbers (leading zeros go away), and _CODES_plus2_CODEE_, who adds 2 to the number. </line>
		</p>
		<img>
			<name height="1">19.1.jpg</name>
			<name height="1">19.2.jpg</name>
		</img>
		<p>
			<line>Imagine a single, compound expression made up of both of these blocks intermingled and composed together (none, some, or possibly very many of each), like the example above: "reverse(reverse(plus2(reverse())))". If the output of this (possibly large) expression were 7, which could have been the input?</line>

	<hint>They are all possible. The secret to this question is that you can drop a zero by reversing a multiple of 10 (as in the example, 1230 becomes 321). That’s easy for even numbers, since you can just get to a multiple of 10, then reverse it twice to drop the 0. For odd numbers it seems impossible, but all you need to do is add 2 until your most significant digit is even, then reverse it, and you’re all set (just add 2 until you get to 700 or 7000 etc and reverse it).</hint>
